# Overview
The numpy-random notebook is for the assignment for this module. It is not an attempt at a tutorial or an in-depth discussion of any of the features of the package( which is best left to the experts), moreover it is a quick overview of what is available in the package, how to use it, brief explanations of their purpose, illustrations of their use and where to go for further information. It covers five statistical distributions in more depth namely uniform,triangular,binomial,normal and pareto. It attempts to use rolling dice and playing cards to demonstrate these distribution in action and there is a gallery of images in the Image folder for that purpose.
